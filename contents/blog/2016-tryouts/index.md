We're very excited to announce tryouts for Freeze 2016! We have three tryout dates scheduled: April 30, May 8, and May 14. The first tryout is open, and the others will be invitation only. We understand that folks might have conflicts with the open tryout date - if you cannot make it to the open tryout, we'll work with you to figure out an alternative.

Here are the details for each tryout:

**Saturday April 30, 9AM-1PM, Lower Genesee Park and Playfield<br>**

**Sunday, May 8, 9AM-1PM, Upper Genesee Park and Playfield<br>**

**Saturday, May 14, 3PM-6PM, Location TBD<br>**

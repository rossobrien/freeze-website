Hello Internet!

Seattle Freeze is back for its third mixed club ultimate season, and we have big goals for 2016! We earned a bid to the USAU Select Flight in 2015, and we hope to attend a Triple Crown Tour event this season. We’re looking to build on last year, and this starts with recruiting the best talent. We will once again be holding open tryouts (most likely starting in late April and concluding by the end of May). We will practice and compete throughout the season with the goal of building individual skills and team cohesiveness. Expect one or two practices a week plus workouts and four or so pre-series tournaments. Oh...and we'll have some fun, too. Through a team culture of positivity, support, and dedication, Freeze will compete with the best out there and show the country just how deep Seattle’s ultimate community is.
